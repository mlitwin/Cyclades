				<div>Ok I was interested in learning some algorithms. The "Tortoise and hare" Cycle detection algorithms seemed cool,
				so off to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycle_detection">Wikipedia</a>! Read through that, and I understood.

			<p>... I couldn't really tell you why they worked. So I need to dig further into it: try to think about it on my own terms,
			 and maybe play with an implementation.

			<p>First, while I love abstraction, the explanation in terms of iterated functions was too abstract for me. So, a more concrete case to think
				about: a nice linked list:
			</p>
			<div class="sketch_canvas" data-var="llsketch" >&nbsp;</div>
			<p>Ok it's a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_list#Singly_linked_list">singly linked list</a>. You've got a pointer to the first node,
				and each node has a pointer to the "next" node (or a sentinel for the end of the list). You can start at the first node, and next your way to the end.
				Unless: some joker has set one of the "next" back to a previous node, in which case you're stuck in an infinte loop. This is the case the
				Cycle Detection algorithms detect.
